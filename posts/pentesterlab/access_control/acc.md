This lab talks about most mistake made by modern frameworks that stores users details using their username as file for example (user_1.json):

we access the challenge link and try checking for the key, but's masked so no way out; we now modify the url content to 1.json and saw the user details in the json file:

This challenge is simillar to the previous one, but in this case we dont edit the user from username to admin but we attach an extra field saying this user is an admin, a dictionary:

```ruby
user[admin] = 1
```

This challenge requires us to join an organization or company by modifying the user field along with username and password we are able to archieve it by adding the following:

```ruby
user[organization_id] = 1
```

we use the above payload to join organization/company 1 while creating the new user.
