# Perplexying Python


This challenge is from MetaCTF 2022, the challenge literally had zero solves till the CTF ended, so i decided to go back to the challenge, a zip file was given:

![](https://blog.cyb3rguru.tech/posts/CTF/files/1688632861897.png)

unziping the zip file we saw two python files:

![](https://blog.cyb3rguru.tech/posts/CTF/files/1688632899815.png)


content of main.py :

![](https://blog.cyb3rguru.tech/posts/CTF/files/1688632958188.png)

from the content of the main.py we could see that the program ask us for a password and verify it by passing it to `verify_password` function

if the password is wrong it print's some dangerous statement that everyone fears ðŸ˜† 

running the main.py file we have:

we could see the impact of inputing wrong password with only 3 attempts....

content of auth.py :

 ![](https://blog.cyb3rguru.tech/posts/CTF/files/1688633003608.png)

we could see the content of auth.py has some base encoded text, de-encoding it we have:

![](https://blog.cyb3rguru.tech/posts/CTF/files/1688633121815.png)

let's break down the functions:


```python
def input(a,*b):
    p=builtins.input(a)
    return "".join([p[i:i+7][::-1] for i in builtins.range(0,len(p),7)])
```

The first function takes care of our input, the function collects our input and randomize it by taking 7 characters at a time and reversing it then returns the combined combination

```python
def system(a):
    import urllib.request, time, random
    for i in urllib.request.urlopen("https://problems.metactf.com/content/perplexing_python/rmrf.txt"):
        if random.random()>0.99:time.sleep(random.uniform(0,1))
        if random.random()>0.9:time.sleep(random.uniform(0,0.2))
        print(i.decode().strip())
```

The next function emulates the system function to print out random text gotten from the remote url.

```python
def triangulars(x):
    o=[]
    for i in builtins.range(2,x):
        for j in builtins.range(2,round(i**0.5)+1):
            if i%j == 0: break
        else: o.append(i)
    return o  
```

The triangulars function returns a range of number from 2 to i^(0.5)+1

```python
def verify_password(pwd):
    from functools import reduce
    pwd=[ord(i)^len(pwd) for i in pwd]
    with open(__file__, "r") as f:d=f.read()
    pwd=[pwd[i]^ord(d[i*3]) for i in builtins.range(len(pwd))]
    n = 0
    t = [i for i in triangulars(1000) if i > 256]
    p = 1
    for i in builtins.range(len(pwd)):
        n += pwd[i]*p
        p *= t[i]
    crt = [[893291192969389,321083022148697],
           [738075405357203,535606301382888],
           [111116004743251439,85887918631122595],
           [189984495189322679,105666774352769436],
           [657759577575876253,576519854972390374],
           [534767534514091169,151381645215045547],
           [5802402697964251471,1097309430872784120],
           [10313116996519561687,3795752970155700631],
           [5280231861548814769,3904915951384167352]]
    return all([n%i[0]==i[1] for i in crt])
```

The `verify_password` function takes in the password, the function now xor's the pwd with the length of the pwd, it then open the whole file (the auth.py file) and xor the pwd with iteration of every i*3 character in the file

The function further computes `t`  by list comprehension of numbers in `triangulars(1000)` that are greater than 256, it now loop through in the range of length of the list   `pwd`  and sum up the product of each content of `t[i] ` multiplied with `pwd[i]` storing it in n and also stores the product of p

At the end of the function we saw an array of list containing large numbers then a `return` statement that returns the  modulo operation `n % i[0] == i[1]` for every element in the `crt` list, `False` if every element in the list is `False` or contains a `False`  and `True` if every element in the list is `True`.

```python
def range(*a): return [2, 1, 0]
```

The last function emulates the `range ` function in python but returns only `[2, 1, 0`

## **Breaking The Challenge**



From the Last operation in the `verify_password` function we could use the `crt` list to compute the value of `n` , from the Concept of Chinese Remainder Theorem which state a number can be represented in linear congurence by it's remainder and modulos, using the CRT algorithm we got `n` as :

![](https://blog.cyb3rguru.tech/posts/CTF/files/1688646355405.png)

using `n` we could recover `pwd` with the help of `t` we could compute t from

```python
t = [i for i in triangulars(1000) if i > 256]
```

then we now compute a `mapping` using the product of each index from base of t :

```python
tt = [257, 263, 269, 271, 277, 281, 283, 293, 307, 311, 313, 317, 331, 337, 347, 349, 353, 359, 367, 373, 379, 383, 389, 397, 401, 409, 419, 421, 431, 433, 439, 443, 449, 457, 461, 463, 467, 479, 487, 491, 499, 503, 509, 521, 523, 541, 547, 557, 563, 569, 571, 577, 587, 593, 599, 601, 607, 613, 617, 619, 631, 641, 643, 647, 653, 659, 661, 673, 677, 683, 691, 701, 709, 719, 727, 733, 739, 743, 751, 757, 761, 769, 773, 787, 797, 809, 811, 821, 823, 827, 829, 839, 853, 857, 859, 863, 877, 881, 883, 887, 907, 911, 919, 929, 937, 941, 947, 953, 967, 971, 977, 983, 991, 997]

mappings = []
t = 1

for i in range(len(tt)):
    mappings.append(t)
    t *= tt[i]
```

Since the operation `n // t == p[i]`  holds true, we could recover pwd :

```python
pwd = []

for i in mappings[:-65][::-1]:
    res = xx // i
    xx -= res * i 
    pwd.append(res)

pwd = pwd[::-1]

```

we got a relative small number at index 65 of the mapping, so this is possibly the length of the `pwd`, we went further and  compute the result and store it in `pwd`, we then reverse the `pwd`since our operation started by recovering the last character of the`pwd` list.

Next phase is to xor the content of `pwd` with the file:

```python
with open("sauth.py", 'r') as f:
    d = f.read()

pwd=[pwd[i]^ord(d[i*3]) for i in range(len(pwd))]

```

Next we xor the current content of `pwd` with the length `65`:

```python
pwd=[i^len(pwd) for i in pwd]

```

At this point we were able to compute the content of the `pwd` list as seen from the `verify_password` function, we now go pack to the `input` function were our `pwd` was reversed  `7` by `7` length and appended, we simply reverse this function by computing it with: 

```python

g = [pwd[i:i+7][::-1] for i in range(0,len(pwd),7)]


```

Then we combine the result and convert it to Characters:

```python
flag = []

for res in g:
    flag = flag + res


print(''.join([chr(x) for x in flag]))
```

Combining all this, Behold, our final script:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
#xx gotten from chinese remainder theorem
xx = 1007530794370674919528700858409178961234447429005443823520140030680322196270661110990236896504373773579753972016930268730878278

tt = [257, 263, 269, 271, 277, 281, 283, 293, 307, 311, 313, 317, 331, 337, 347, 349, 353, 359, 367, 373, 379, 383, 389, 397, 401, 409, 419, 421, 431, 433, 439, 443, 449, 457, 461, 463, 467, 479, 487, 491, 499, 503, 509, 521, 523, 541, 547, 557, 563, 569, 571, 577, 587, 593, 599, 601, 607, 613, 617, 619, 631, 641, 643, 647, 653, 659, 661, 673, 677, 683, 691, 701, 709, 719, 727, 733, 739, 743, 751, 757, 761, 769, 773, 787, 797, 809, 811, 821, 823, 827, 829, 839, 853, 857, 859, 863, 877, 881, 883, 887, 907, 911, 919, 929, 937, 941, 947, 953, 967, 971, 977, 983, 991, 997]

mappings = []
t = 1

for i in range(len(tt)):
    mappings.append(t)
    t *= tt[i]


with open("sauth.py", 'r') as f:
    d = f.read()

pwd = []

for i in mappings[:-65][::-1]:
    res = xx // i
    xx -= res * i 
    pwd.append(res)

pwd = pwd[::-1]

pwd=[pwd[i]^ord(d[i*3]) for i in range(len(pwd))]

pwd=[i^len(pwd) for i in pwd]

flag = []
g = [pwd[i:i+7][::-1] for i in range(0,len(pwd),7)]

for res in g:
    flag = flag + res

print(''.join([chr(x) for x in flag])) 
```

Running the script we have our `pwd`/`flag` :

### **Remarks**

well looking back i couldn't have solved this Challenge back then during the CTF with the amount of knowledge/experience i had then ðŸ˜• , but with constant grinding and learnning i was able to come back and solve it. It was a nice challenge that required critical thinking which i love the most ðŸ˜„
